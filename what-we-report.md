# What we report

In order to improve hypertension treatment for a clinic or even an entire population, you have to understand how the system is performing. You need to see if patients are getting healthy, if they're being treated, if they're coming back for follow-up visits, and if they're being registered into the system.

Simple collects the bare minimum of information necessary to identify a patient, treat the patient for hypertension, and schedule a follow-up. We aggregate this information to report the following key indicators to help track hypertension care:

1. [Registrations](https://app.gitbook.com/@simpledotorg/s/docs/~/drafts/-MYfp73eLYHeDsbjbL5z/what-we-report#registrations)
2. [Total assigned patients](https://app.gitbook.com/@simpledotorg/s/docs/~/drafts/-MYfp73eLYHeDsbjbL5z/what-we-report#total-assigned-patients)
3. [BP controlled](https://app.gitbook.com/@simpledotorg/s/docs/~/drafts/-MYfp73eLYHeDsbjbL5z/what-we-report#bp-controlled)
4. [BP not controlled](https://app.gitbook.com/@simpledotorg/s/docs/~/drafts/-MYfp73eLYHeDsbjbL5z/what-we-report#bp-not-controlled)
5. [Visited but no BP taken](https://app.gitbook.com/@simpledotorg/s/docs/~/drafts/-MYfp73eLYHeDsbjbL5z/what-we-report#visited-but-no-bp-taken)
6. [Missed visits](https://app.gitbook.com/@simpledotorg/s/docs/~/drafts/-MYfp73eLYHeDsbjbL5z/what-we-report#missed-visits)

## Registrations

**Monthly registered patients:** the number of patients registered at a facility during a month where the patient:

* is not deleted
* is hypertensive

```text
/* Sample SQL query */
SELECT Count(DISTINCT "patients"."id") AS count_id,
       Date_trunc('month', "patients"."recorded_at"::timestamptz AT TIME ZONE 'ETC/UTC') AT TIME ZONE 'ETC/UTC' AS date_trunc_month_patients_recorded_at_timestamptz_at_time_zone_
FROM "patients"
INNER JOIN "medical_histories" ON "medical_histories"."deleted_at" IS NULL
AND "medical_histories"."patient_id" = "patients"."id"
WHERE "patients"."deleted_at" IS NULL
  AND "patients"."registration_facility_id" = $1
  AND "medical_histories"."deleted_at" IS NULL
  AND "medical_histories"."hypertension" = $2
  AND ("patients"."recorded_at" IS NOT NULL)
GROUP BY date_trunc('month', "patients"."recorded_at"::timestamptz AT TIME ZONE 'ETC/UTC') AT TIME ZONE 'ETC/UTC' [["registration_facility_id", "2e768fb2-9de0-4a7d-a64d-9f5b4c1863f4"],["hypertension", "yes"]]"
```

**Total registered patients:** the number of patients registered at a facility

_This indicator is calculated by adding monthly registrations at a facility over time_

## Total assigned patients

The number of patients a facility is responsible to control their hypertension where a patient:

* is not deleted
* is hypertensive
* is not dead

**Note:** A new patient is automatically assigned to the facility they were registered. It's very common for patients to be registered at large hospitals and re-assigned to smaller clinics near their homes. This makes it much easier for patients to continue their hypertension treatment and helps facilities know how many patients they need to follow-up and assess medication needs.

```text
/* Sample SQL query */
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "patients"."id") AS count_id,
       DATE_TRUNC('month', "patients"."recorded_at"::timestamptz AT TIME ZONE 'ASIA/KOLKATA') AT TIME ZONE 'ASIA/KOLKATA' AS date_trunc_month_patients_recorded_at_timestamptz_at_time_zone_
FROM "patients"
INNER JOIN "medical_histories" ON "medical_histories"."deleted_at" IS NULL
AND "medical_histories"."patient_id" = "patients"."id"
WHERE "patients"."deleted_at" IS NULL
  AND "patients"."assigned_facility_id" = $1
  AND "medical_histories"."deleted_at" IS NULL
  AND "medical_histories"."hypertension" = $2
  AND "patients"."status" != $3
  AND ("patients"."recorded_at" IS NOT NULL)
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', "patients"."recorded_at"::timestamptz AT TIME ZONE 'ASIA/KOLKATA') AT TIME ZONE 'ASIA/KOLKATA' [["assigned_facility_id", "fdbeb339-770f-4021-a81a-44f9bc9a5e79"],["hypertension", "yes"],["status", "dead"]]

```

##  BP controlled

The number of patients assigned to a facility registered before the last 3 months where the patient:

* is not deleted
* is hypertensive
* is not dead
* has a BP measure taken within the last 3 months
* last BP measure taken is &lt;140/90

```text
/* Sample SQL query */
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM
  (SELECT DISTINCT ON (latest_blood_pressures_per_patient_per_months.patient_id) *
   FROM "latest_blood_pressures_per_patient_per_months"
   WHERE (medical_history_hypertension = 'yes')
     AND "latest_blood_pressures_per_patient_per_months"."patient_status" != $1
     AND "latest_blood_pressures_per_patient_per_months"."assigned_facility_id" = $2
     AND (patient_recorded_at <= '2019-07-31 18:29:59.999999')
     AND (bp_recorded_at >= '2019-07-31 18:30:00'
          AND bp_recorded_at <= '2019-10-31 18:29:59.999999')
   ORDER BY latest_blood_pressures_per_patient_per_months.patient_id,
            bp_recorded_at DESC, bp_id) latest_blood_pressures_per_patient_per_months
WHERE (systolic < 140
       AND diastolic < 90) [["patient_status", "dead"],["assigned_facility_id", "399c52a8-4b49-41d4-8704-cc3985ac26e6"]]
```

_Note: We display this key indicator as a rate where the denominator is total assigned patients registered before the last 3 months._

**Why are patients registered within the last 3 months excluded?** Three months gives patients time to take their hypertension medication. Most newly registered patients are hypertensive, and including them would not reflect an accurate picture of actual controlled patients.

## BP not controlled

The number of patients assigned to a facility, registered before the last 3 months where the patient:

* is not deleted
* is hypertensive
* is not dead
* has a BP measure taken within the last 3 months
* last BP measure taken is &gt;=140/90

```text
/* Sample SQL query */

```

## Visited but no BP taken

The number of patients assigned to a facility, registered before the last 3 months where the patient:

* is not deleted
* is hypertensive
* is not dead
* has at least one of the following in the last 3 months: An appointment created, A drug refilled, A blood sugar taken
* doesnâ€™t have any BPs recorded within the last 3 months

* is hypertensive
* is not dead
* doesnâ€™t have a visit or BP recorded within the last 3 months

```text

## Inactive facilities

Facilities where &lt;10 patients had any BPs recorded in the last 7 days

**How it's calculated:** First we calculate total active facilities \(Facilities where &gt;10 patients had any BPs recorded in the last 7 days\). Then we:

* Grab all facilities the admin has access to
* Count the total number of patients with a BP taken in a day for the last 7 days at each facility
* Returns the number of facilities where the facility has had more than 10 patients with a BP taken in the last week

## Cohort reports

![Sample monthly cohort report for May 2020](.gitbook/assets/cohort-reports.png)

Hypertension control takes time, and cohorts allow us to track a set of patients receiving treatment over time. We take all the patients registered in a given period of time and look to see if they returned for care during a subsequent period of time. If they returned to care, we look to see if their blood pressure was under control.

We use monthly cohorts to quickly track performance, and quarterly cohorts to determine systematic improvements over longer timeframes.

The calculations for monthly and quarterly cohorts are the same. The only difference is in the registration period \(month versus quarter\).

### Monthly cohort reports

**BP controlled numerator:** The number of patients assigned to a facility registered during a month where the patient:

* is hypertensive
* is not deleted
* is not dead
* has a last BP in the following 2 months
* last BP is &lt;140/90
